# process names are case-insensitive
# you can use 'master' to indicate the master channel, or a list of process names to create a group
# you can use 'mic' to control your mic input level (uses the default recording device)
# you can use 'deej.unmapped' to control all apps that aren't bound to any slider (this ignores master, system, mic and device-targeting sessions)
# windows only - you can use 'deej.current' to control the currently active app (whether full-screen or not)
# windows only - you can use a device's full name, i.e. "Speakers (Realtek High Definition Audio)", to bind it. this works for both output and input devices
# windows only - you can use 'system' to control the "system sounds" volume
# important: slider indexes start at 0, regardless of which analog pins you're using!

# be sure to convert hex values to decimal (hex values start with 0x)
# for example: to get F13 (0x7C + 0xFFF)
# 0x7C  = 124
# 0xFFF = 4095
# 124 + 4095
# F13 = 4219

# MAKE SURE THE NUMBER OF BUTTONS IN THE CONFIG MATCHES THE NUMBER OF BUTTONS REPORTED BY THE ARDUINO
# If the number of buttons is not the same, deej might crash
